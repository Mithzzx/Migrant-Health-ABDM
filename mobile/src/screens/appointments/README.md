```

## Design System Integration

### Theme Compliance

- Consistent with app's healthcare green (`#43A047`) primary color
- Light gray background (`#F2F5F7`) with white surface cards
- Typography follows app's hierarchy (titles, body text, captions)

### Component Usage
- **React Native Paper**: Material Design components (Cards, Buttons, TextInput, etc.)
- **Navigation**: Integrated with existing stack navigation
- **Internationalization**: Uses `useI18n` hook for text translations
- **Safe Area**: Proper safe area handling for different devices
